# Rubic-s-Cube-Processing

Apologies. I am new in Github and don't know much about how to use. 
I have tried to create Rubic's Cube using Processing3.

To rotate any side, just press respective initial of color of center side for clockwise rotation and for anticlockwise rotation use shift key. To shuffle the cube, press 's'.
